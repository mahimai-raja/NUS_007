## About

This is the official project repository of the team 7 for National University of Singapore, GAIP.

## Technologies

* Python 3
* Tensorflow 2.1.8 / Keras
* scikit-learn
* OpenCV
* Flask
* Matplotlib



## Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approach

Several models were trained for this task (as a learning experience). Ultimately, the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) approach was chosen as the best of all when compared to other model's performance.

* The image dataset was augumented using keras libraries and they we preprocessed using OpenCV libraries.
* Using the preprocessed data an convolutional neural network was developed with a single layer of 512 neurons and several dropout layers.

## Source of Data

The data folder was downloaded from [KAGGLE](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/parkinsons-drawings) which provides the open source datasets.
